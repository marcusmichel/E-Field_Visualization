# E-Field_Visualization
MatLab code used to visualize electric field data gathered from Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) simulations. The data can be plotted as 2D components, 2D magnitude, and 2D + 3D vector fields, and compared against other simulations using the same geometry and dipole spacings.

This program is specifically designed for a certain structure that my research was centered on (namely, plasmonic waveguides), but can be used and modified to display the results of any DDA E-field simulations. 

# Shape Plotter
DDA requires geometry files in order to run calculations, and these geometry files are text-based, so it is difficult to spot any issues in the shape file making process. This program allows a user to visualize these shape files by plotting 2D cross sections, colored depending on the material type.
